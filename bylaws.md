subsequent withdrawal of members, so as to reduce the number of
members in person or represented by proxy entitled to vote at the
meeting below the number required for a quorum, shall not affect the
validity of any action taken at the meeting or any adjournment

Board of Directors may participate in a meeting of such Board or of
any committee designated by such Board by conference telephone,
internet voice conference, or similar communications medium by means
of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each
other at the same time. Participating by such means shall constitute
presence in person at a meeting.

permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of 
any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all the 
members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent

of the board or committee. Such consent shall have the same effect 
as a unanimous vote.

other transaction between the corporation and one or more of its 
directors or between the corporation and any other corporation, 
partnership, association or other organization in which one or more

such relationship or interest or solely because such director or 
directors are present at or participate in the meeting of the Board 
of Directors or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or 
ratifies such contract or transaction or solely because his or her 
or their votes are counted for such purpose, if:  The material facts 
as to the director's relationship or interest and as to the contract or
transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or
committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith

to engage directly or indirectly in any activity which the
corporation believes would be likely to invalidate its status as an

### Indemnification of Officers and Directors  

**Section 13.1. Right to Indemnification.** Each person who was or 
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, 
pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, 
criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action 
by or in the right of the corporation), by reason of the fact that 
he or she is or was a director, officer or member of the 
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the 
corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another 
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other 
enterprise, shall be entitled to indemnification against expenses 
(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid 
in settlement to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by 
applicable law as long as such person acted in good faith and in 
a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in or not be 
opposed to the best interests of the corporation; provided, 
however, that the corporation shall indemnify any such person 
seeking indemnity in connection with an action, suit or proceeding 
(or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such action, 
suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board 
of Directors.

**Section 13.2. Advance Payment of Expenses.**
Expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any
person who is or was an officer, director or member of the
corporation, or who is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as an officer or director of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, in defending
any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or
proceeding, shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if
it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled under
applicable law to be indemnified by the corporation.

**Section 13.3. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit.** If a claim 
under this Article is not paid in full by the corporation within 
ninety (90) days after a written claim has been received by the 
corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit 
against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the 
claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall 
be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such 
claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an 
action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in 
defending any action or proceeding in advance of its final 
disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to 
the corporation unless such action is based on the claimant 
having committed an act involving moral turpitude) that the 
claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make 
indemnification permissible under the General Corporation Law of 
the State of Delaware, but the burden of proving such defense shall 
be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation 
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or 
its members) to have made a determination prior to the commencement 
of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in 
the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard 
of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of 
Delaware, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including 
its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its members) 
that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, 
shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the 
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

**Section 13.4. Contract Rights.** The provisions of this Article 
shall be a contract between the corporation and each director, 
officer or member to which this Article applies. No repeal or 
modification of these Bylaws shall invalidate or detract from any 
right or obligation with respect to any state of facts existing 
prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

**Section 13.5. Rights Non-exclusive.** The indemnification and 
advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this 
Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
 which those seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of members
or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or
her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office.

**Section 13.6. Insurance.** The corporation shall purchase and 
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, 
officer, member, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was 
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, 
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint 
venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted 
against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, 
or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the 
corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against 
such liability under the provisions of this Article or of 
applicable law. The corporation shall purchase and maintain general 
liability insurance, supplemented as necessary to cover any special 
events the corporation may hold.

**Section 13.7. Definitions.** For purposes of this Article, 
references to "the corporation" shall include, in addition to the 
resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any 
constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or 
merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have 
had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and 
employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, 
officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is 
or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as 
a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, 
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
shall stand in the same position under this Article with respect 
to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have 
with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate 
existence had continued, and references to "other enterprises" 
shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall
include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any
employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request
of the corporation" shall include any service as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties
on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or
agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, 
or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a 
manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be
deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation" as referred to in this Article.

**Section 13.8. Continued Coverage.** The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to this
Article shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or
ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer or member and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such person.

Electronic Signatures.** Any document requiring the signature of

signatories had signed the same document. Such executions may be 
transmitted to the corporation and/or the other directors and/or 
members by facsimile, or by electronically signed delivery in a 
form accepted by the Board of Directors, and such facsimile or 
electronically signed execution shall have the full force and 
effect of an original signature. All fully executed counterparts, 
whether original executions or facsimile or electronically signed 
executions or a combination, shall be construed together and shall 
constitute one and the same agreement.

identity of each voter and the date that such vote is made can be 
verified.  No vote conducted pursuant to this Section 14.8 may 
remain open for more than sixty (60) days after the commencement of 
the applicable voting period.  Each such vote shall have a specific 
approval requirement identified prior to the commencement of such

forth in the corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, these 
Bylaws or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The
