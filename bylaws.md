not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be
transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of
the members need be specified in the written waiver of notice.

or agent having charge of the membership records of the corporation 
shall prepare and make available within five (5) days of written 
request from any voting member, a complete list of the members

in alphabetical order, showing the name and email address of record 
of each voting member, and shall be made available subject to 
conditions that enable the Corporation to fulfill its obligations 
under any relevant data privacy laws and otherwise protect the 
rights and privacy of its members, provided that such conditions do

under Section 3.3.

Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, one-third (1/3) of the
members entitled to vote (the voting members), represented in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of members.

class of members (if the members are divided into classes), one third 
(1/3) of such class of members, represented in person or represented 
by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of such item 
of business by that class of members.

members represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject
matter shall be the act of the members, unless the vote of a greater
number or voting by class is required by the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware or by the Certificate of Incorporation or

members present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote on the election of directors.

affirmative vote of a plurality of members of such class represented
at the meeting shall be the act of such class unless the vote of a
greater number is required by the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

After a quorum has been established at a members'meeting, the
subsequent withdrawal of members, so as to reduce the number of
members in person or represented by proxy entitled to vote at the
meeting below the number required for a quorum, shall not affect the
validity of any action taken at the meeting or any adjournment
thereof.

After a quorum has been established at a members' meeting, the 
subsequent admission of new members, so as to increase the number of 
members required for a quorum above the number of members present in 
person or represented by proxy entitled to vote at the meeting, shall 
not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting or any 
adjournment thereof.

required to be taken or which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of members of the corporation may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if:

  1. a written consent setting forth the action so taken shall be 
  signed by members having not less than the minimum number of votes 
  that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a 
  meeting at which all members entitled to vote thereon were present 
  and voted; provided, however, that no written consent shall be 
  effective unless such consent (A) bears the date of signature by

Directors election.

References in these Bylaws to a "voting member" or to the "voting 
members" of the corporation, or to the "members entitled to vote,"

desiring membership must complete a written or electronic membership

member of another membership class.

**Section 4.4. Basic Members.** Any right or privilege granted to a 
Basic Member is also held by members of the other classes, but other 
classes of members may have rights and privileges not granted to 
Basic Members. Members may be voluntarily or involuntarily converted 
to basic status. Basic Members have no voting rights and are not 
included in the membership count for purposes of establishing a

have voting rights in the corporation and are counted for the purposes

Directors.

Contributing Members must certify through a method approved by the 
Board of Directors, that such member met and will continue to meet the 
requirements set forth in this Section 4.7 in order to remain a 
Contributing Member for the following year.

Any software or other works of authorship produced as part of a 
Contributing Member's certified volunteer work must be made available
to the public at no charge under an open source license.

Contributing Members have voting rights in the corporation and are
counted for the purposes of quorum at meetings of the members.

The Board of Directors may, from time to time, create alternate
eligibility requirements for Contributing Members.

**Section 4.8. Fellows.** To be eligible for membership as a Fellow, 
a member must be nominated by any Member of the corporation other
than a Basic Member, or by a specially chartered Working Group, which 
nomination should be based upon certain criteria to be established by 
the Board of Directors and which criteria shall be designed to emphasize 
extraordinary contributions. Following such nomination, approval of two-
thirds (2/3) of the members entitled to vote, or two-thirds (2/3) of the 
members of the chartered Working Group, or two-thirds (2/3) of the Board of 
Directors, shall be required in order for a member to become 
a Fellow. Upon election, a Fellow shall remain a Fellow for the remainder of 
such person's natural life, subject to any limiting provisions of this 
document. Fellows may exercise voting rights at any time, and if they vote, 
shall be counted for purposes of a quorum.

Fellows have voting rights in the corporation. Fellows are always considered
voting members as per section 4.2. Fellows are not subject to section 4.12.

shall automatically become a Fellow without any further action on the part
of such member or the corporation unless such member affirmatively declines
such right in writing to the corporation.

**Section 4.10. Voting Rights for Members of Multiple Membership 
Classes.** In the event that a member qualifies as a member of more 
than one membership class (e.g. a member is both a Supporting Member 
and a Contributing Member), such member shall only have one (1) vote with 
respect to any action requiring the approval of the members or certain 
classes thereof.

time upon ten (10) days written, signed notice delivered to an 
officer of the corporation.

may withdraw from membership in the corporation at any time upon

may be terminated by an affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the 
members of the corporation who are present and eligible to vote at 
the meeting.

A Member's (including any Fellow's) membership may be terminated for 
failure to meet any condition of membership (including violation of
the Code of Conduct or non-payment of membership fees) by an 
affirmative vote of the majority of the Board of Directors. The Board
shall give the Member at least 15 days’ notice of the termination and
the reasons for the termination, and an opportunity for the Member to 
be heard by the Board, orally or in writing at the Board’s decision, 
at least five days before the effective date of the termination.

**Section 4.16. Effect of Withdrawal from or Termination of 
Membership.** Upon any withdrawal from or termination of the 
membership of any member, the membership, including all related 
voting rights, of such member shall be terminated. After a
withdrawal or termination of the membership of any member, such 
former member may reapply for membership in accordance with Section
4.3 of these Bylaws.

to change the number of directors during a meeting of the members shall 
be deemed to take effect before the election of any individual 
directors during the same meeting.

2017 annual meeting of members and at each annual meeting thereafter,
the voting members shall elect directors sufficient to fill

which he or she is elected and until his or her successor shall have 
been elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation, 
removal or death.

Upon completion of the term beginning after the 2017 elections, 
directors shall be elected for a three-year term, unless they are 
replacing a director that resigned or was removed, in which case such 
replacement directors shall be elected to a term sufficient to
complete a three-year term as measured from the term of the original
cohort. Replacement directors shall be chosen in order of the number
of votes received, with the longest terms of service being allocated
to candidates according to the number of votes received.

Persons elected as at-large directors are considered to be seated

is seated as a director, then the person receiving the next highest
number of votes is selected.

of Directors, including any vacancy created by reason of an increase
in the authorized number of directors, may be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though
less than a quorum of the Board of Directors or by a sole remaining
director. If there is more than one class of members entitled to
nominate directors, vacancies of directorships elected by such class
may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class
or by a sole remaining director. A director elected to fill a
vacancy shall hold office only until the next election of directors
by the members.

**Section 5.8. Quorum and Voting.** A majority of the number of 
directors fixed in accordance with these Bylaws shall constitute a

extent provided in such authorizing resolution, shall have and may 
exercise all the power and authority of the Board of Directors in 
the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, as 
limited by the laws of the State of Delaware, except such committee 
shall not have the power or authority to amend these Bylaws or to 
approve or recommend to the members any action which must be 
submitted to members for approval under the General Corporation Law 
of the State of Delaware. Any Executive Committee established by the
Board of Directors shall be composed exclusively of Directors. The
rights and composition of any Executive Committee shall be established
by the motion establishing such committee.  Any member serving on an

an alternate to any committee member who is absent from a meeting of
the committee or who has ceased to be a member of the committee. The

other at the same time.

the meeting. If notice is sent by postal mail, it must be sent at 
least fourteen (14) days before the meeting.  Notice of a meeting of 
the Board of Directors need not be given to any director who signs a
waiver of notice, either before or after the meeting. Attendance of
a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such
meeting and waiver of any and all objections to the place of the
meeting, the time of the meeting, or the manner in which it has been
called or conveyed, except when a director states, at the beginning
of the meeting, any objection to the transaction of business because
the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Members of the
Board of Directors may participate in a meeting of such Board or of
any committee designated by such Board by conference telephone,
internet voice conference, or similar communications medium by means
of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each
other at the same time. Participating by such means shall constitute
presence in person at a meeting.

**Section 5.12. Action Without a Meeting.** Any action required or 
permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of 
any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all the 
members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent 
thereto in writing or by other electronic means pursuant to Section 
14.8, and such consent is filed with the minutes of the proceedings 
of the board or committee. Such consent shall have the same effect 
as a unanimous vote.

**Section 5.13. Director Conflicts of Interest.** No contract or 
other transaction between the corporation and one or more of its 
directors or between the corporation and any other corporation, 
partnership, association or other organization in which one or more 
of the directors of the corporation are directors or officers or are 
financially interested, shall be void or voidable solely because of 
such relationship or interest or solely because such director or 
directors are present at or participate in the meeting of the Board 
of Directors or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or 
ratifies such contract or transaction or solely because his or her 
or their votes are counted for such purpose, if:  The material facts 
as to the director's relationship or interest and as to the contract or
transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or
committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith
authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction by the
affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even
though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or:  The
material facts as to their relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or known to the members
entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is
specifically approved in good faith by vote of such members; or:  The
contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation at the time it
is authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of Directors, a
committee of the Board of Directors or the voting members.  Common

thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies such contract or
transaction.

the purposes of this section, a Board Member or prospective Board 
Member has an affiliation if that person is an employee, officer, 
or member of the Board of Directors of an entity; if that person 
has a significant consulting relationship with an entity; or that 
person owns at least 1% of the equity or debt, or derivatives 
thereof, of an entity.

than one quarter (1/4) of the members of the Board of Directors may
share a common affiliation as defined in Section 5.14. If the number
of co-affiliated directors goes above the limit due to a change in
employment or a corporate acquisition, then, unless otherwise agreed
between the co-affiliated members, the longest-serving member(s)
of the Board of Directors sharing that affiliation must resign before
the next meeting of the Board of Directors to bring the total number of 
co-affiliated directors below the limit. 

A person who would bring the Board of Directors above the limit on
co-affiliation is ineligible to be seated or appointed.

For purposes of this Section, a common affiliation includes all 
organizations that, directly or indirectly through one or more 
intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control 
with the other entities declared as affiliations by other members
of the Board of Directors.

amended (the "IRC"), and until such time, if ever, that such
exemption is denied or lost, the corporation shall not be empowered
to engage directly or indirectly in any activity which the
corporation believes would be likely to invalidate its status as an
organization exempt from federal taxation under Section 501(a) of

corporation of such alteration, amendment or repeal at least fifteen

### Indemnification of Officers and Directors  

**Section 13.1. Right to Indemnification.** The corporation 
shall, to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by 
applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless any person (a 
“Covered Person”) who is made a party to, or threatened to
be made a party to, any action, suit, or proceeding, whether 
civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other 
than an action by or in the right of the corporation) (a 
“Proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she is or 
was a director or officer of the corporation or, while a 
director or officer of the corporation, is or was serving 
at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, 
employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, 
joint venture, trust, or other enterprise (including service
with respect to employee benefit plans), against all 
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including 
attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by the that person. 
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the corporation 
shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnity in 
connection with an action, suit or proceeding (or part 
thereof) initiated by such person only if such action, 
suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by 
the Board of Directors.

**Section 13.2. Advance Payment of Expenses.** The corporation 
shall pay the expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) 
actually and reasonably incurred by a Covered Person in 
defending any Proceeding for which the Covered Person is 
entitled to indemnification under Section 13.1 in advance 
of its final disposition, upon (a) written request from such 
person and (b) receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of 
such person to repay all amounts advanced if it is ultimately
determined that he or she is not entitled under applicable 
law to be indemnified by the corporation.
    
**Section 13.3. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit.** If a claim 
under this Article is not paid in full by the corporation within 
ninety (90) days after a written claim has been received by the 
corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit 
against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the 
claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall 
be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such 
claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an 
action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in 
defending any action or proceeding in advance of its final 
disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to 
the corporation unless such action is based on the claimant 
having committed an act involving moral turpitude) that the 
claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make 
indemnification permissible under the General Corporation Law of 
the State of Delaware, but the burden of proving such defense shall 
be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation 
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or 
its members) to have made a determination prior to the commencement 
of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in 
the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard 
of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of 
Delaware, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including 
its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its members) 
that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, 
shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the 
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

**Section 13.4. Contract Rights.** The provisions of this Article 
shall be a contract between the corporation and each director, 
officer or member to which this Article applies. No repeal or 
modification of these Bylaws shall invalidate or detract from any 
right or obligation with respect to any state of facts existing 
prior to the time of such repeal or modification. 

**Section 13.5. Rights Non-exclusive.** The indemnification and 
advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this 
Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
 which those seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of members
or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or
her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office.

**Section 13.6. Insurance.** The corporation shall purchase and 
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was
a director or officer of the corporation or, while a director 
or officer of the corporation, is or was serving at the request 
of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent 
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or 
other enterprise against any liability asserted against him 
or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or 
arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the 
corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her 
against such liability under the provisions of this Article 
or of applicable law. The corporation shall purchase and 
maintain general liability insurance, supplemented as 
necessary to cover any special events the corporation may hold.

**Section 13.7 Definitions.** The text of this section has 
been removed, but the heading preserved, in order to maintain 
references to subsequent sections.

**Section 13.8. Continued Coverage.** The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to this
Article shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or
ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director
or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such person.

Electronic Signatures.** Any document requiring the signature of 
the directors and/or members may be executed in any number of

signatories had signed the same document. Such executions may be 
transmitted to the corporation and/or the other directors and/or 
members by facsimile, or by electronically signed delivery in a 
form accepted by the Board of Directors, and such facsimile or 
electronically signed execution shall have the full force and 
effect of an original signature. All fully executed counterparts, 
whether original executions or facsimile or electronically signed 
executions or a combination, shall be construed together and shall

person, such notice will be deemed to be delivered immediately. If
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited
in the United States mail or with an express mail service provider,
addressed to the recipient at his or her address of record, with
postage thereon prepaid. If faxed or emailed, such notice shall be
deemed to be delivered when the recipient, or a representative of
the recipient, confirms receipt.

**Section 14.8. Electronic Voting.** Any vote of the Board of 
Directors, any committee, or the members may be conducted through 
electronic means and shall have the same effect as action taken by 
written consent; provided that such voting mechanism meets the 
criteria set forth in this Section 14.8. Any vote conducted through 
electronic means must be done through a mechanism by which both the 
identity of each voter and the date that such vote is made can be 
verified.  No vote conducted pursuant to this Section 14.8 may 
remain open for more than sixty (60) days after the commencement of 
the applicable voting period.  Each such vote shall have a specific 
approval requirement identified prior to the commencement of such 
vote, which requirement shall not be less than the requirements set 
forth in the corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, these 
Bylaws or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The 
effective date of any vote conducted through electronic means shall 
be the first date upon which the requisite threshold for approval of
